# TMDL: A Formal Language for Describing AI Team Members

**Working paper** (not yet peer-reviewed)

## Abstract

TMDL (TeamMate Description Language) is a YAML-based specification language for defining virtual teammates powered by LLMs that collaborate effectively with human teams. Building on the ADL (Assistant Description Language) framework, TMDL introduces contribution-centered design principles and structured collaboration protocols, enabling the creation of AI agents that integrate naturally into team workflows.
